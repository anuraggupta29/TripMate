This website is supposed to provide a simple interface to a user and recommend him/her the best place to go
based on the distance of the place and current crowd at that location. The crowd data is supposed to be acquired
from a raspberry pi based people counter at the location. The  website will also generate a safety score of the
location based on time of day, crime data, transportation, distance from hospital, police station.
